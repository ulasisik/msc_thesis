\section{Datasets}
In this study, I analyzed 19 microarray gene expression datasets to investigate age-related gene expression heterogeneity change during development and aging.
The datasets retrieved from 3 independent published studies~\cite{Colantuoni2011, Kang2011, Somel2011, Somel2010}, containing microarray data for the human brain.
Overall, the datasets included 1010 samples from 298 individuals spanning 17 different brain region. 
All datasets have samples covering whole lifespan with ages ranging from 0 to 98 years (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:fig2.1}}).
A summary of datasets used in this study is shown in \textbf{Table~\ref{table:table1}}.

It should also be noted that Kang2011 datasets contain samples from left and right hemispheres of the same individual.
These samples were analyzed as biological replicates, meaning that samples were not seperated into two different datasets, for three reasons.
First, it was previously suggested that left and right hemispheres of the brain may show asymmetric age-related changes~\cite{Sun2005, Dolcos2002}.
Second, the other datasets do not contain hemisphere information.
Last, previous studies analyzing this dataset, including the original study, also treated them as biological replicates~\cite{Kang2011,Donertas2017}.

The datasets were downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using the accession codes given in \textbf{Table~\ref{table:table1}}. 
All the analysis was performed in R programming environment.

\subsection{Seperating development and aging datasets}
Since the aim of this study to investigate age-related gene expression change during postnatal development and aging, all the datasets were seperated into two datasets: (i) development (0 to 20 years of age) and  (ii) aging (20 to 98 years of age).
The age of 20 was used to seperate development and aging for the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The age of 20 was shown to correspond approximately to the age of reproduction in human societies~\cite{Walker2006}.
    \item Previous studies investigating age-related gene expression trajectories demonstrated that 20 years of age corresponds to a turning point of gene expression patterns\cite{Colantuoni2011, Donertas2017,Somel2010}.
    \item Earlier research connected the structural changes occuring in the human brain after the age of 20 to age-related phenotypes~\cite{Sowell2004}
\end{enumerate}

As a result, I obtained:
\begin{itemize}
    \item One development and one aging dataset for the Colantuoni2011;
    \item 16 development and 16 aging datasets for the Kang2011;
    \item Two development and two aging datasets for the Somel2011.
\end{itemize}
Overall, both development and aging datasets resulted in a comparable number of samples ($n_{development} = 441$; $n_{aging}=569$).

\section{Dataset Preprocessing}
The Kang2011 and Somel2011 datasets were generated by Affymetrix HuEx-1\char`_0-st and HuGene-1\char`_0-st microarray platforms, respectively. 
Colantuoni2011 dataset, on the other hand, was generated using HEEBO-7 set, which is an Illumina based array. 
Since there is no public R library available to process Illumina based data, I used the expression data preprocessed by the authors of the original study~\cite{Colantuoni2011}.

For the data from Kang2011 and Somel2011 sources, I downloaded .CEL files from GEO database.
