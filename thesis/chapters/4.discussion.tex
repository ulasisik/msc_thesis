aim and description 

seperation point and focusing on consistent changes

\section{Higher correlation in expression changes during development}

expression changes

\section{Higher correlation in heterogeneity changes during aging}
heterogeneity changes

\section{Increased heterogeneity consistency in aging}
heterogeneity consistency

\section{Increased heterogeneity is a biological effect}
increased heterogeneity is not technical artifact or low statistical power:
- mean-variance dependence
- pmi
- different sepration points
- affect of sex
- not a result of an outlier sample (i.e., one older individual having too high/low expression)


\section{Limitations \& future perspectives}
There are a number of limitations of this study that should be pointed out. The first one is related to microarray data. 
- Cannot confidently identify gene-sets showing consistent increase.
