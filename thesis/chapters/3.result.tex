In this study, I investigated the age-related gene expression heterogeneity change by analyzing 19 microarray datasets
containing 1,010 samples from diverse brain regions of 298 individuals, and covering whole lifespan.
To compare heterogeneity change occuring during before and after adulthood, each dataset were first seperated into two datasets: development dataset 
(including samples with ages ranging from 0 to 20 years old) and aging dataset (including samples with ages ranging from 20 to 98 years old).

\section{Age-related gene expression change}
While the aim of this study to investigate age-related changes in gene expression heterogeneity, I first sought to characterize age-related change in gene expression.
Linear regression was performed to characterize the relationship between gene expression and age for each gene and dataset separately (\textbf{Section \ref{sub:exp-change}} ).
